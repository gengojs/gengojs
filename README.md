##News
It's here! It's finally here! Welcome to version 1.0.0-alpha. As the version implies, this version of gengo is not production ready. It's published so that I can get some feedback and of course test it myself. In fact, I already have a couple of thoughts about bringing the core and the plugins into the same repo because individually maintaining them myself is a difficult task. In the meantime, feel free to try it out and report any bugs or suggestions. As far as docs are concerned, it may take a while for me to write as I try to organize everything up and make gengo.js simple enough to extend and make it the best i18n module.

##Test

```bash
# make sure to install the node modules
npm install

# run test
grunt
```
